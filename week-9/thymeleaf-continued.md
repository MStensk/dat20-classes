# Thymeleaf continued

Last week we familarized ourselves with Thymeleaf. We can use Thymeleaf for more advanced scenarios that we will be looking at today.



## Why are we even continuing talking about Thymeleaf

Thymeleaf is a powerful system and can do things like fragments, translation, and logic. This can be super useful when developing a site.



## Learning goals

- Thymelear syntax (variable, expressions)
- Thymeleaf fragments
- Iterating a list of objects



## Thymeleaf syntax

There is quite a bit of detail in the Thymeleaf syntax. I will be talking about a few of them: https://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/tutorials/3.0/usingthymeleaf.html#standard-expression-syntax



### If

https://www.baeldung.com/spring-thymeleaf-conditionals

```html
<td>
    <span th:if="${teacher.gender == 'F'}">Female</span>
    <span th:unless="${teacher.gender == 'F'}">Male</span>
</td>
```



### Switch

https://www.baeldung.com/spring-thymeleaf-conditionals

```html
<td th:switch="${numberOfCourses}">
    <span th:case="'0'">NO COURSES YET!</span>
    <span th:case="'1'" >A course</span>
</td>
```



### Link url's

https://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/articles/standardurlsyntax.html

Relative to where the app is deployed it will give the correct url. So if running localhost the link will look like this: `http://localhost:8080/lol`

```html
<a th:href="@{/product}">product</a>
```



### Literal substitutions

```html
<span th:text="|Welcome to our application, ${user.name}!|">
```



## Fragments

On a standard website we probably have about 30 html pages. Imagine that you get the task to change the logo image in the header. Imaging going to every single one of those pages looking for the logo image, rewriting the image `src` but probably also the `alt` attribute. That would be quite a task and what if you forgot that one hidden page? Now you have the old logo showing to customers (this is something the author have literally done so its not even a thought up example ðŸ˜†)

For exactly that reason we use fragments.



### What is fragments

Fragments is a way to reuse html on different pages. You could fx create a header fragment with the logo and the navigation links. Now when you create a new page, you simply use the Header fragment in that page. 



### Practical example

Lets add a `header` to another page

`src/main/resources/templates/fragments/header.html`

```html
<html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org">
  <header>
  	<a href="/">
    	<img src="/logo.png" alt="Company logo" />
    </a>
    <nav>
    	<ul>
        <li><a href="home">Home</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>
</html>
```



`src/main/resources/templates/product.html`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlnd="http://thymeleaf.org">
	<header th:replace="fragments/header.html"></header>
  <body>
    <h1>Product page</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```



### Fragment Parameters

You can pass in parameters to your fragment! And it's nearly like just calling a method

`fragments/header.html`

```html
<html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org">
  <header>
  	<a href="/">
    	<img src="/logo.png" alt="Company logo" />
    </a>
    <p th:text="${currentPage}"></p>
    <nav>
    	<ul>
        <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>
</html>
```



```html
<header th:replace="fragments/header.html(currentPage='home')"></header>
```





##### Fragment selector 

You can also select a specific part (fragment) of the fragment:

```html
<header th:replace="products/fragments/users-login.html :: logged-in"></header>
```

`/fragments/sers-login.html`

```html
<html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org">
  <p th:fragment="logged-in">
      User logged in
  </p>
  <p th:fragment="logged-out">
      User logged out
  </p>
</html>
```



### Changing class of an element

```html
<a href="" class="baseclass" th:classappend="${isAdmin} ? adminclass : userclass"></a>
```

If `isAdmin` is `true`, then this will result in

```html
<a href="" class="baseclass adminclass"></a>
```



### Exercise

Continuing the social media exercise:



Create 3 fragments:

1. A `head` fragment. Where the `title` of the page can be configured as a parameter. You should also add your `css` and other things you have in your `head`
2. A `header` fragment. The header fragment should have a parameter called `currentPage`. The value of current page is the current page name. That could fx be `dashboard`, `submit`, `home`, etc. In the navigation part of the `header` the current page should be highlighted (maybe with bold text or some other background color) Like seen in the screenshot below
3. A `footer`. No parameter here.
